# RealState_MVC
Real estate website for selling your property, browsing or purchasing other properties, and, as an administrator, performing CRUD operations on real estate listings and platform users.

The website is built on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, utilizing a router to invoke relevant functions. Each URL is associated with a function in a class. This function performs necessary operations, and the data obtained from this processing (Controller) is sent to a router function called 'render' to display the associated view (View).

Sass (enhances css workflow) and Composer (package management in PHP) have been used as development tools.
